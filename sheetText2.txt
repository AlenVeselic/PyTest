Before I go on to my problem at hand you will need some context,
I work 4 shifts so you know this makes my sleeping schedule very dynamic in case I was going
to get judged on my sleeping habits.

So the past few weeks when I got home after my afternoon shift at 23:00 I could hear terrible screaming
and yelling coming from beyond my flat's walls. I decided not to investigate on their first occurence since I
am not one to be interfeering in or settling domestic disputes. So I let it be for that night.
But then it happened again, and again and there were not only screams, now children were crying,
dogs were yelping in pain. What the hell is going on in this flat complex? I'm starting to fear
my safety as a resident here. I look forward to serence nights in the future when this nightmare ends.
