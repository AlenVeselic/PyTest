# PyTest
Checking out Python for the first time with the book "Automate the boring stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart.

If a file has a lowercase p at the start it's a practical project that I did myself.

If a file has an uppercase C at the end it means that there was an example with code on the other page which I tried myself before looking at it.

All the other files are examples with the exception of "errorTesting.py" which is for testing errors and temporarily trying out smaller examples or ideas.
